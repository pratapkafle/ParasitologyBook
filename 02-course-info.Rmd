This course is scheduled for 30 lectures, 5 class discussions, and 2 exams.

Introductory lectures will provide a basic understanding of parasitology, highlighting key definitions and concepts, and introducing the major taxonomic groups of parasites (helminths, arthropods, and protozoa).

After the introduction, material will be presented by host species. For each host, we will discuss helminths, then arthropods, then protozoa. Topics covered for each parasite include host and geographic distribution, life cycle, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and principles of control. The emphasis will be on parasites of clinical importance in domestic animals mainly in North America, as well as parasites that have zoonotic potential.

PDF versions of Powerpoint slides will be posted online prior to each class. Students are welcome to record lectures for personal use. Lecture capture may be offered if requested.
