# Instructor Info {-}

Dr. Pratap Kafle is a veterinarian from Nepal. He completed his DVM in 2011 and practiced as a field vet in Nepal for almost 2 years before moving to Canada to pursue graduate studies. He completed his PhD in 2018 from University of Calgary, where he studied the ecology of host-parasite interaction in the Canadian Arctic. He has experience in areas of diagnostic parasitology, disease ecology and ecological modelling. His postdoctoral work involved modelling gastropod distribution in the Canadian Arctic. He also delivered parasitology course at the University of Saskatchewan, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. He is very excited to be here and looks forward to working together with the students to make this course a great learning experience.
