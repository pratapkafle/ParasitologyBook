You can call me by my first name (Pratap) or Dr. Kafle, or Prof. Kafle, whatever you like! I am a veterinarian by training and I received my specialization in Parasitology during my graduate study and professional work in Canada. I got my DVM in 2011 and practiced as a mixed animal vet in Nepal for almost 2 years before moving to Canada to pursue graduate studies. I completed my PhD in 2018 from University of Calgary, where I studied the ecology of host-parasite interaction in the Canadian Arctic using fieldwork, lab experiments and ecological modeling. My postdoctoral work at the University of Calgary and University of Saskatchewan involved studying a variety of parasites of wildlife, pets and humans and researching Coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) in Canadian wildlife. I co-taught veterinary parasitology course to the DVM students at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan. I am pretty excited to be here and I look forward to working together with you all to make this course a great learning experience. Where to find me? You can email me anytime at kaflepratap@gmail.com during the office hours. I will try my best to respond during the weekend/holidays but I can’t gurantee as I have a pretty young family and I try to work less during the weekends.

The common term for this relationship between organism is SYMBOSIS (Sam meaning “together” and bioses meaning “living” ). Each member of the association is called a symbiont. There are five types of symbiotic relationships: Predator-prey : ⁃ One species (predator) benefits at the expense of the other (prey) ⁃ Extremely short-term relationship ⁃ Eg: Lion and Zebra - Lion (predator) kills zebra (prey) for food. Phoresis (phore meaning “to carry”): ⁃ Smallest member is mechanically carried about by the larger member ⁃ E.g.: Mutualism: ⁃ Each species dependent on the other for their mutual well-being and survival (e.g. cellulose-digesting organisms in the caecum of a horse). Commensalism: ⁃ One symbiont benefits and the other is neither benefited nor harmed. ⁃ E.g: Parasitism Parasitism is the mode of existence in which one organism, the parasite, infects another, the host, and the parasite does some measure of harm to the host while itself deriving a benefit. Parasitism is one of the most common lifestyles on earth. Parasitism is part of a spectrum of intimate zoological relationships between unrelated organisms The features of this ecological relationship are:[^1] the parasite is physiologically dependent on the host; the infection process produces or tends to produce an over-dispersed distribution of parasites within the host population; the parasite kills heavily infected hosts; the parasite species has a higher reproductive potential than the host species. Parasitism can occur in varying degrees Parasitiasis: Parasite within the host is potentially harmful but the host doesn’t show obvious clinical signs of the disease. E.g : Cattle on pasture may carry trichrongyles (roundworms) without showing any clinical signs Parasitosis: Parasite produce obvious harm/injury to the host manifested by clinical signs E.g.: Emaciated cow on pasture certainly carries roundworms.

Parasitology Parasitology is the study of parasitism; a multidisciplinary subject encompassing many topics including morphology, taxonomy, biology, behaviour, life-cycles, pathogenesis, epidemiology, ecology, physiology, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology, as well as the diagnosis, immunology and treatment of parasitic infections. why should we study parasitology? The field of veterinary parasitology has important implications for human and animal health. Parasites remain the major cause of numerous clinical and subclinical diseases in humans, domestic animals, wildlife often resulting in loss of lives and productivity. Hence, parasites can cause tremendous economic loss, and greatly impede the economic development of some countries, especially in the tropics. We must study parasites because parasites are: Causative agents of numerous diseases Vectors of infectious agents Causative ages of zoonoses Problems in food hygiene Impact trade Animal welfare Economic factors To do anything about this requires deep knowledge of parasite life cycles, modes of infection, immunology, pathogenesis, and other facets of their biology. It’s estimated that at least half of all known species are parasitic, so understanding the life cycle and interaction of these organisms with their hosts is often key to understanding the dynamics of ecosystems generally. Parasites are fascinating organisms in their anatomy, physiology, and behavior, and we can learn a lot about life in general by studying them from a biological perspective even parasites that have no impact on the health of humans or the animals we care about. Nearly 40% of the species on earth are parasitic of some kind. Parasites are often overlooked in trophic interactions but they represent the major share of all trophic interactions. They have the ability to shape community structure through their effects on trophic interactions, food webs, competition, biodiversity, and keystone species.1 2 https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/ecological-consequences-of-parasitism-13255694/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128141120000052?via%3Dihub↩︎ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128141120000052?via%3Dihub↩︎ "],["list-of-parasites-covered.html", "List of parasites covered", " List of parasites covered GI nematodes Parasite name Niche LifeCycle Intermediate hosts PPP Spirocerca lupi Esophagus Indirect Coporphagous beetles 2-3 months Physaloptera Stomach Direct None 5 months ** Non GI** "],["physaloptera-spp-.html", " 1 Physaloptera spp. 1.1 Taxonomy 1.2 Epidemiology 1.3 Life Cycle 1.4 Pathogenesis 1.5 Diagnosis 1.6 Treatment 1.7 Control/Prevention 1.8 Morphology of adult stage and egg states", " 1 Physaloptera spp. 1.1 Taxonomy Phylum : Nematoda Class: Secernenta Order: Spirurida Family: Spirocercidae Genus: Spiricerca Species: S. lupi 1.2 Epidemiology Definitive hosts: Mainly domestic dogs, occasionally some species of wild canids (red foxes [S. vulpis], black-backed jackals, wolves, coyotes). Occasionally in cats. Intermediate hosts: Coprophagous beetles Other hosts: Sometimes, a variety of paratenic (transport) hosts may be involved like: mice hedgehogs, lizards, birds, and rabbits may ingest beetles and remain infected, which transmit the infection to the definitive hosts Distribution: S. lupi has a worldwide distribution but the prevalence is higher in tropical and subtropical regions (eg, Greece, India, Israel, Japan, South Africa). In USA infections are monstly seen in southern region. Sporadic cases are reported in temperate regions (e.g. Canada ), mostly with travel history to the tropical regions. 1.3 Life Cycle Females lay embryonated eggs in esophageal nodules. The eggs are released into the esophageal lumen through small openings and pass to the environment through the feces or vomit. Coprophagous beetles (intermediate hosts) ingest the eggs where the eggs hatch and moult into infective (L3) stage within 2 months. The L3 are encapsulated which helps the eggs to survive for longer time in the environment and remain infective. Definitive hosts are infected when they accidentally ingest the infected beetle containing L3 stages. Sometimes, a variety of paratenic (transport) hosts including: mice hedgehogs, lizards, birds, and rabbits may ingest beetles and remain infected, which transmit the infection to the definitive hosts when they are preyed upon. In the definitive hots, the L3 are freed in the stomach within two days. The larvae penetrate the the gut wall and start migrating within the walls of the gastric arteries to the thoracic aorta. By day 10 post-infection, worms can be found in the caudal thoracic aorta wall and migrate cranially through the vessel wall for up to 100 days, during which L3 moults into L4 preadult stage. About 3 months post-infection, the larvae migrate from the aorta to the esophagus and establishes in the submucosal layer. The L4 preadults trigger the formation of a nodule that protrudes into oesophageal lumen where final moulting occurs. Each nodule may contain several adult worms in a greasy, crumbly mass. Aberrant migration in the thoracic cavity, nervous system, subcutaneous tissues, or urinary tract can also occur. Adult male and female S. lupi complete their development and mature approximately 161 days after infection of their canine host. The prepatent period from the dog’s infection to the initial shedding of infective eggs is 121–124 days, and adult S. lupi can then survive in their canine host for 2 years or more, thus, disseminating infective eggs for prolonged periods. Lifecycle of S. lupi. (1) adult worms live in submucosal nodes in the posterior part of the esophagus; (2) females lay larvated eggs that pass through an opening made into the mucosa to the esophagus and further to the intestine and in feces or with vomit into the environment; (3) the larva hatches only when it reaches the intermediate host, a coprophagic beetle. The development to the infective L3 phase lasts about 2 months; (4) the definitive host is infected by eating an infected intermediate host or a paratenic host; (5) the larva penetrates the stomach wall of the definitive host and migrates along the stomach wall and the gastric arteries to the aorta; and (6) the L3 stage develops into a L4-stage larva in the aortic wall. About 3 months later, most of the larvae migrate to the esophagus and mature. (Image from Saari et al., 20193) 1.4 Pathogenesis Larval migration and localization of the adult worms within host tissues is associated with esophageal granulomas and sarcomas (fibrosarcomas, osteosarcomas, undifferentiated sarcomas), aortic aneurysms and thrombosis, thoracic diskospondylitis and spondylosis, hypertrophic osteopathy, salivary gland necrosis, and pyothorax. Sarcomas are almost exclusively localized to the esophagus. The clinical signs of spirocercosis are non-specific and are caused by the migration of larvae through the body as well as the space-occupying nodules in the oesophagus. The most common clinical signs include retching, vomiting, weight loss and difficulty in swallowing. Enlargement of salivary glands resulting in excessive drooling of saliva or sialorrhea have been associated with S. lupi infection. Thickening of the forelimb bones has also been documented in the late, cancerous stages of the disease. 1.5 Diagnosis Fecal Examination Characteristic ellipsoid embryonated eggs with smooth clear egg shell [egg size: 30-38 x 11-15 µm] in direct fecal smears or by fecal flotation methods with a 1.27 specific gravity sugar suspension has been recommended for the best egg yield. Rarely eggs can be found in thoracic fluid Flotation Repeated fecal examinations are warranted due to intermittent shedding of eggs. Fecal sedimentation is best but fecal flotation can be used (less sensitive). Radiology Thoracic radiography allows the detection of parasite-induced lesions (caudal thoracic spondylitis and dense masses in the esophagus. CT generally provides more information on the location and severity of the infection than radiographs. Esophagoscopy and sometimes gastrocopy can help direct visualization of the nodules. The nodules may have nipple-like orifice from which a worm may protude. Molecular diagnosis - PCR of adult worms, eggs or larval stages 1.6 Treatment Treatment of clinical cases is often not practical. Doramectin (0.2 mg/kg, SC, three doses at 2-wk intervals; 0.4 mg/kg, SC, six doses at 2-wk intervals; 0.5 mg/kg, SC, two doses 2 wk apart; 0.5 mg/kg/day, PO, for 42 days; 0.8 mg/kg, SC, two doses 1 wk apart; additional treatments may be required), and with ivermectin (0.6 mg/kg, SC, two doses 2 wk apart) combined with prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg, PO, bid for 2 wk and then tapered), has shown some success although none of these treatments is approved In Europe, monthly treatment with topical moxidectin/imidacloprid is approved for use in dogs as a preventive for S lupi infection. The specific breed toxicity associated with ivermectin in Collies and other herding dog breeds also occurs with doramectin. Surgical removal of esophageal nodules or tumours largely unsuccessful due to extensive nature of lesions and post surgical complications. 1.7 Control/Prevention Preventing dogs from ingesting beetles or potential paratenic hosts in order to avoid infection with S. lupi. Clearingdog feces rapidly and preventing access of beetle vectors to fecal material. In endemic regions, a preventative regimen of doramectin injected subcutaneously every 2 months is used, in an attempt to kill the developing migrating larvae at an early stage of the parasite life cycle in the dog. 1.8 Morphology of adult stage and egg states https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128141120000052?via%3Dihub↩︎ "],["spirocerca-lupi.html", " 2 Spirocerca lupi 2.1 Taxonomy 2.2 Epidemiology 2.3 Life Cycle 2.4 Pathogenesis 2.5 Diagnosis 2.6 Treatment 2.7 Control/Prevention 2.8 Morphology of adult stage and egg states", " 2 Spirocerca lupi 2.1 Taxonomy Phylum : Nematoda Class: Secernenta Order: Spirurida Family: Spirocercidae Genus: Spiricerca Species: S. lupi 2.2 Epidemiology Definitive hosts: Mainly domestic dogs, occasionally some species of wild canids (red foxes [S. vulpis], black-backed jackals, wolves, coyotes).
