There is a lot of information within this practical book and **we do not expect you to read everything we link to**. You should attend each lecture, go through every practical and do some associated reading. 

This is a 15 credit module, equivalent to 150 hours of study (including the taught sessions). Outside of our lectures and practical sessions (3 hours a week) **you should be spending an extra 12 hours a week on this module**.
